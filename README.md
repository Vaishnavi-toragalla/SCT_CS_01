Caesar Cipher Program 🔐
This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption algorithm. It demonstrates how text can be encoded and decoded using a shift value, making it an excellent learning tool for cryptography concepts.

📝 What is the Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher named after Julius Caesar. It shifts each letter in a message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. It’s simple, yet it illustrates the foundations of encryption.

Encryption: Shifts characters forward by the specified value.
Decryption: Shifts characters backward to retrieve the original message.

🎯 Features
Interactive User Interface: Enter text and a shift value to encrypt or decrypt it instantly.
Handles Special Characters: Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged (e.g., spaces, punctuation).
Case Sensitive: Maintains the case of letters (e.g., A stays uppercase).

📋 How to Use
Clone this repository or download the project files.
Open the index.html file in any modern browser.
Input:
A message in the message box.
A shift value in the shift field.
Click:
Encrypt to encode the message.
Decrypt to decode the message.
The result will be displayed below the buttons.

🔍 Example
Input Message: Hello, World!
Shift Value: 3
Output:
Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!
Decrypted: Hello, World!

🚀 Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the interface.
CSS: For basic styling and layout.
JavaScript: For encryption and decryption logic.
